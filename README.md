# Logula

Logula is home-made blog generation program made to run totempaal.tj, my
personal website. It is currently incredibly specialized just for whatever
I want it to be doing, and probably nothing you'd ever want it to do. You
could look around and maybe change it to your wishes, be my guest.

As everything I do, I suppose it's written for extension and customization,
but that doesn't mean that you should do that. It's not licensed yet and as
such it's still All Rights Reserved.
